## IMPORTANT NOTES

### Content Quality First
- Never prioritize keywords over user value
- Natural language flow > keyword density
- Write for humans, optimize for search
- Quality content ranks better than keyword-stuffed content

### Gradual Implementation
- Roll out internal links gradually (not all at once)
- Spread content updates over time (not same-day)
- Monitor after each major change
- Adjust strategy based on real performance data

### Continuous Optimization
- SEO is ongoing, not one-time project
- Plan for quarterly reviews and adjustments
- Monitor algorithm changes and competitor activity
- Maintain content freshness (quarterly updates)

### Avoid These Pitfalls
- Keyword stuffing (unnatural language)
- Over-optimization (too many links from single page)
- Ignoring user experience (fast loading, mobile-friendly, clear navigation)
- Neglecting existing strengths (don't break what works)
- Short-term focus (think 6-12 months, not weeks)
