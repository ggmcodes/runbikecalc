If your marathon is in early April, start training in mid-December. For a late May marathon, you can begin in early February. Ideally, you should have a running base of 15-25 miles per week before starting formal marathon training."

Have a rotation of 2-3 pairs to extend shoe life and prevent overuse injuries. For race day, consider a lighter, more responsive shoe with a carbon plate for improved efficiency. Break in any new shoes for at least 3-4 weeks before race day. Replace training shoes every 300-500 miles."

Week 3 before race: reduce mileage by 20-25%. Week 2 before race: reduce by 40-50%. Race week: reduce by 60-70% with your last meaningful run 2-3 days before the marathon. Maintain some faster running (strides, short tempo) to keep legs sharp. Increase sleep and nutrition focus during taper."

A recent half marathon time is the best predictor - multiply by 2.1 to 2.2 for realistic marathon time. For example, a 1:45 half marathon predicts a 3:40-3:51 marathon. Practice goal pace during long runs in the final 6-8 weeks of training. Be conservative with your goal - running even splits or slight negative splits leads to better race experiences than starting too fast."

This typically means one gel every 30-45 minutes or consistent sports drink intake at aid stations. Practice your exact fueling strategy during long training runs. Take gels with water, not sports drink, to avoid GI issues. Have a plan for aid station locations and what you'll consume at each."

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A successful spring marathon requires 16-20 weeks of structured preparation. Start in December or January for April-May marathons. The training breaks into four phases: <strong>base building</strong> (weeks 16-13), <strong>building phase</strong> (weeks 12-9), <strong>peak training</strong> (weeks 8-5), and <strong>taper</strong> (weeks 4-1). Use this checklist to ensure nothing falls through the cracks as you prepare for 26.2 miles.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">When should I start training for a spring marathon?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">For a spring marathon (typically April-May), start your 16-week training plan in December or January. If your marathon is in early April, start training in mid-December. For a late May marathon, you can begin in early February. Ideally, you should have a running base of 15-25 miles per week before starting formal marathon training.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What running shoes should I use for marathon training?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Use well-cushioned daily trainers for most of your training miles. Have a rotation of 2-3 pairs to extend shoe life and prevent overuse injuries. For race day, consider a lighter, more responsive shoe with a carbon plate for improved efficiency. Break in any new shoes for at least 3-4 weeks before race day.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How should I taper for a marathon?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">A proper marathon taper typically lasts 2-3 weeks. Week 3 before race: reduce mileage by 20-25%. Week 2: reduce by 40-50%. Race week: reduce by 60-70% with your last meaningful run 2-3 days before the marathon. Maintain some faster running (strides, short tempo) to keep legs sharp.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="border-b pb-4">
                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What should I eat before a marathon?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">The night before, eat a familiar carbohydrate-rich dinner. Race morning, eat 3-4 hours before start time: 300-500 calories of easily digestible carbohydrates like toast with honey, oatmeal with banana, or a bagel with peanut butter. Drink 16-20 oz of water or sports drink. Only eat foods you've tested in training.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What gear do I need for marathon training?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Essential gear includes: 2-3 pairs of quality running shoes, a GPS running watch, moisture-wicking clothing for all weather, a hydration vest or belt for long runs, anti-chafe products, and running socks. Recommended additions: foam roller, compression socks, headlamp, and race day nutrition to practice during training.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I choose my marathon pace?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Base your marathon pace on recent race performances. A recent half marathon time is the best predictor - multiply by 2.1 to 2.2 for realistic marathon time. Practice goal pace during long runs in the final 6-8 weeks. Be conservative - running even splits or slight negative splits leads to better race experiences.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What should I do the week before a marathon?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Race week priorities: Reduce training to 50-60% of normal. Focus on sleep (8+ hours nightly). Increase carbohydrate intake in final 2-3 days. Stay hydrated but don't overdo it. Lay out all race gear. Pick up race packet early. Visualize race day success. Trust your training.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I fuel during a marathon?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Start fueling early - take your first gel around mile 4-5. Aim for 30-60 grams of carbohydrates per hour. This typically means one gel every 30-45 minutes. Practice your exact fueling strategy during long training runs. Take gels with water, not sports drink, to avoid GI issues.</p>

                    <li><strong>Gear up early:</strong> Purchase and test all equipment well before race day</li>
                    <li><strong>Build progressively:</strong> Follow the 16-week structure without skipping phases</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice everything:</strong> Nutrition, pacing, and gear should all be tested in training</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust the taper:</strong> Reduced training is part of the plan, not lost fitness</li>
                    <li><strong>Execute conservatively:</strong> Start slow and finish strong</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-700">You've put in the work. On race day, trust your training and enjoy the experience. See you at the finish line!</p>
