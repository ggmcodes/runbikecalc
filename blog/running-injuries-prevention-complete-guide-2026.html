                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Understanding Running Injuries</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Running injuries affect 30-75% of runners annually, depending on how injury is defined. The majority are overuse injuries—gradual tissue breakdown from repetitive stress—rather than acute traumatic injuries. Understanding this distinction is crucial because overuse injuries are largely preventable.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Every stride places 2-3 times your body weight through your legs. Over thousands of repetitions, small imbalances, weaknesses, or training errors accumulate. The tissue breaks down faster than it can repair, eventually crossing the threshold into pain and dysfunction.</p>

                <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 my-6">
                    <p class="text-red-800 font-medium">The 10% Rule: Increase weekly mileage by no more than 10% per week. This gives tissues time to adapt. However, even this rule isn't foolproof—some runners can handle more, others need even slower progression.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Injury Continuum</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Injuries don't appear overnight. They progress through stages:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Tissue stress:</strong> Normal training load, tissues adapting</li>
                    <li><strong>Tissue strain:</strong> Mild discomfort, recovers overnight</li>
                    <li><strong>Tissue damage:</strong> Pain during activity, needs rest to recover</li>
                    <li><strong>Tissue failure:</strong> Significant injury requiring extended rest</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Catching problems early—at the strain stage—allows quick recovery. Ignoring warning signs leads to longer layoffs.</p>

                    <li>Follow 10% rule for weekly mileage increases</li>
                    <li>Build in recovery weeks every 3-4 weeks (reduce volume 20-30%)</li>
                    <li>Increase either volume or intensity, not both simultaneously</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Hip strengthening:</strong> Clamshells, side-lying leg raises, monster walks</li>
                    <li><strong>Glute activation:</strong> Bridges, single-leg deadlifts, lunges</li>
                    <li><strong>Core stability:</strong> Planks, dead bugs, bird dogs</li>
                    <li><strong>Calf/ankle:</strong> Heel raises, single-leg balance</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Aim for 2-3 strength sessions per week, 20-30 minutes each.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Acute Phase (First 48-72 Hours)</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The old RICE protocol has evolved. Current thinking:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Protect:</strong> Avoid activities that aggravate injury</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimal Loading:</strong> Some movement is better than complete rest</li>
                    <li><strong>Ice:</strong> Can help with pain; 15-20 minutes several times daily</li>
                    <li><strong>Compression:</strong> May reduce swelling</li>
                    <li><strong>Elevation:</strong> Helps reduce swelling in lower extremities</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Subacute Phase</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Gradually increase activity within pain tolerance</li>
                    <li>Cross-training to maintain fitness (swimming, cycling, pool running)</li>
                    <li>Begin rehabilitation exercises</li>
                    <li>Address underlying causes (strength, flexibility, form)</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">When to Use Anti-Inflammatories</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) can reduce pain but may impair tissue healing. Use sparingly:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li>Acceptable for acute pain management (first few days)</li>
                    <li>Avoid chronic use—inflammation is part of healing</li>
                    <li>Never use to mask pain so you can run through injury</li>
                    <li>Consider acetaminophen as alternative for pain without anti-inflammatory effects</li>
