                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Peloton</strong> is a fitness product - excellent for motivation, community, and general fitness. It's the better choice for people who want guided workouts, aren't serious cyclists, and value the social/gamification aspects of the Peloton ecosystem.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Wahoo KICKR</strong> is a cycling training tool - designed for cyclists who want to train on their actual bike with accurate power data. It's better for anyone training for outdoor events, following structured training plans, or wanting platform flexibility (Zwift, TrainerRoad, etc.).</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> Serious cyclists should choose Wahoo. Fitness enthusiasts who want motivation and community should consider Peloton. These products serve different purposes.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Peloton or Wahoo better for indoor cycling?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">It depends on your goals. Peloton is better for guided, motivating workouts with community features. Wahoo KICKR is better for cyclists who want accurate power training on their actual bike and platform flexibility.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is more accurate for power?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Wahoo KICKR is significantly more accurate (+/-1%) compared to Peloton's +/-10-20%. For serious training where power accuracy matters, Wahoo is essential.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the total cost over 3 years?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Peloton costs approximately $3,029 over 3 years (bike + mandatory subscription). Wahoo with Zwift costs approximately $1,839. Wahoo saves about $1,190 over 3 years, plus you retain your bike's value.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I use my road bike with Peloton?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">No, Peloton is a standalone bike - you cannot attach your road bike. Wahoo KICKR lets you ride your actual bike indoors, maintaining your fit and pedal system.</p>

                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Peloton worth it for serious cyclists?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Generally no. Peloton's fit doesn't match your road bike, power accuracy is lower, and structured training is limited. Serious cyclists benefit more from smart trainer setups.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Does Wahoo KICKR work with Peloton app?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, but integration is limited - it doesn't control KICKR resistance. Most Wahoo users prefer Zwift, TrainerRoad, or Wahoo SYSTM for full smart trainer integration.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which has better classes?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Peloton has more classes with broader variety. Wahoo SYSTM (and TrainerRoad) has fewer but more structured, science-based workouts. Peloton wins for entertainment; structured apps win for training effectiveness.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can you use Zwift with Peloton?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Not directly - Peloton bikes don't broadcast power to external apps. Wahoo KICKR integrates perfectly with Zwift for full resistance control and accurate power.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Wahoo KICKR quiet enough for apartments?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, the KICKR is very quiet - often quieter than Peloton. Direct drive technology produces minimal noise, making it apartment-friendly for early morning or late night sessions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
                        <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is better for weight loss?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Both are effective when used consistently. Peloton's gamification may help some with motivation. Wahoo offers more workout variety through multiple platforms. Choose whichever you'll actually use regularly.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Final Verdict</h2>
                <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-6">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Peloton</strong> excels as a fitness product with outstanding classes, community, and motivation features. If you want an all-in-one solution for general fitness and don't care about training on your actual bike, Peloton delivers a compelling experience.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Wahoo KICKR</strong> is the clear choice for cyclists. Better power accuracy, the ability to ride your own bike, platform flexibility, and lower long-term costs make it superior for anyone serious about cycling performance.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">These are fundamentally different products. Choose Peloton for fitness entertainment; choose Wahoo for cycling performance. Both are excellent at what they do - just make sure you're buying the right tool for your goals.</p>
