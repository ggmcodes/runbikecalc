Adding resistance bands and a few dumbbells expands options significantly. A gym offers more equipment variety and heavier loads for advanced training, but isn't required for injury prevention and basic strength development."

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Runners Need Strength Training</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        For years, runners believed that running more was the only way to get faster. Strength training was seen as unnecessary - or worse, counterproductive by adding "bulk." Modern research has completely flipped this thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Studies consistently show that runners who incorporate strength training experience <strong>fewer injuries, improved running economy, faster times, and longer careers</strong>. Elite runners at every distance - from 800m specialists to ultramarathoners - now include strength work as a non-negotiable part of their training.
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 mb-4">
                        <p class="text-blue-800"><strong>The Research Says:</strong> A meta-analysis of 26 studies found that strength training improved running economy by 2-8% and time trial performance by 2-5%. For a 4-hour marathoner, that's 5-12 minutes faster with no additional running volume.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Key Benefits for Runners</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Injury prevention:</strong> Stronger muscles, tendons, and connective tissue handle running stress better</li>
                        <li><strong>Running economy:</strong> Stiffer leg springs mean less energy wasted with each stride</li>
                        <li><strong>Fatigue resistance:</strong> Strong muscles maintain form longer, especially in the final miles of a race</li>
                        <li><strong>Power production:</strong> Better hill climbing and kick at the finish</li>
                        <li><strong>Correcting imbalances:</strong> Most runners have weak glutes and hips relative to their quads</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        The goal isn't to become a bodybuilder. It's to build <strong>functional strength</strong> that makes you a more efficient, resilient runner. This requires a specific approach different from traditional gym training.

                        Notice a pattern? Almost every common running injury relates to <strong>weak hips, glutes, or lower leg muscles</strong>. Running develops your aerobic system brilliantly but creates muscular imbalances that lead to injury over time.

                        <p class="text-yellow-800"><strong>The Hip Connection:</strong> Research shows that most running injuries - not just obvious hip problems - can be traced to hip weakness. Weak hips cause the knee to collapse inward, the foot to overpronate, and the lower back to compensate. Fix the hips, prevent most injuries.</p>

                        Strong glutes drive your stride, stabilize your pelvis, and protect your knees. Most runners have "sleepy glutes" that don't fire properly.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Plyometrics are explosive exercises that train your muscles to produce maximum force quickly. For runners, this translates to more powerful push-offs, better hill climbing, and faster finishing kicks.
                    </p>

                    <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-4 mb-4">
                        <p class="text-red-800"><strong>Important:</strong> Plyometrics are high-impact and demanding. Only add them after building a foundation of basic strength (8+ weeks of consistent strength training). Start with low volumes and progress gradually.</p>

                        <li><strong>Split Jump Lunges:</strong> 2x6 each leg. Explosive switch, controlled landing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skipping:</strong> 2x30 meters. Exaggerate height and arm drive.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Do plyometrics 1-2x per week, typically on the same day as your hard running workout (they complement each other as high-intensity work). Never do plyometrics when fatigued or before a long run.

                        When you do strength training matters almost as much as what you do. Poor timing can compromise both your running and your strength gains.

                        <li><strong>Never before hard runs:</strong> Don't do heavy strength before intervals, tempo runs, or long runs. Fatigued muscles compromise running form and increase injury risk.</li>
                        <li><strong>After easy runs is ideal:</strong> Easy runs + strength on the same day, with hard runs on separate days, keeps your hard days hard and easy days easy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Allow recovery:</strong> Don't do heavy lower body strength the day before a hard running workout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduce before races:</strong> Cut strength volume (not completely) in the 1-2 weeks before goal races.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                    <div class="space-y-4">
                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">How often should runners do strength training?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">Most runners benefit from 2-3 strength sessions per week, lasting 20-45 minutes each. During peak training or race weeks, reducing to 1-2 maintenance sessions is advisable. Quality and consistency matter more than frequency - two solid sessions per week beats sporadic longer workouts.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">Will strength training make me too bulky for running?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">No. Building significant muscle mass requires a caloric surplus and specific bodybuilding-style training. Runner-focused strength training with moderate weights and higher reps builds functional strength without adding bulk. Elite runners from 5K to ultra distances incorporate strength work without becoming bulky.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">Should I do strength training before or after running?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">It depends on priorities. For most runners, do strength after easy runs or on separate days from hard running workouts. Never do heavy strength before key running sessions (intervals, tempo, long runs). If running is the priority, keep strength as supplemental. Some athletes prefer morning runs and evening strength, or vice versa.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">What's the best strength exercise for runners?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">If you could only do one exercise, single-leg exercises like lunges or single-leg deadlifts provide the most running-specific benefit. Running is essentially single-leg hopping - training each leg independently addresses imbalances and builds sport-specific stability. However, a balanced program with multiple exercises is always better than relying on one movement.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">Do I need a gym for runner strength training?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">No. Many effective runner strength exercises use only bodyweight: lunges, single-leg squats, glute bridges, planks, and calf raises. Adding resistance bands and a few dumbbells expands options significantly. A gym offers more equipment variety and heavier loads for advanced training, but isn't required for injury prevention and basic strength development.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">How quickly will I see results from strength training?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">Neural adaptations (feeling stronger, better coordination) happen within 2-4 weeks. Injury prevention benefits begin almost immediately. Performance improvements typically appear after 6-12 weeks of consistent training. Long-term benefits (significant running economy gains) develop over 6+ months. Consistency is key - stick with it!</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">Should I strength train during taper?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">Yes, but reduce volume. During taper, maintain 1-2 short sessions with lighter weights and fewer sets. The goal is maintaining the neuromuscular adaptations you've built without creating fatigue. Drop strength completely only in the final 3-5 days before your goal race.</p>
