                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Functional Threshold Power (FTP) represents the maximum power you can sustain for approximately one hour. Think of it as your "hour power" - the highest average wattage you could hold if you went absolutely all-out for 60 minutes.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">FTP sits at the boundary between sustainable and unsustainable exercise. Below your FTP, your body can clear lactate as fast as it produces it. Above FTP, lactate accumulates and you'll eventually be forced to slow down.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Why FTP Matters</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">FTP is the cornerstone of structured cycling training. Without an accurate FTP, your training zones are wrong, which means you're either training too hard (risking burnout and overtraining) or too easy (leaving gains on the table).</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Raw FTP vs W/kg</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Raw FTP in watts doesn't tell the whole story. A 70kg cyclist with 250W FTP has 3.57 W/kg, while an 85kg cyclist with 280W has only 3.29 W/kg. Despite lower absolute power, the lighter cyclist would climb faster.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Calculate your W/kg:</strong> FTP (watts) / Body Weight (kg)</p>

                <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Example Calculation</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">If your FTP is 250 watts and you weigh 70kg:</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 font-mono mt-2">250W / 70kg = 3.57 W/kg</p>

                    <li>Warm up thoroughly: 20 minutes including some short efforts</li>
                    <li>Perform a 5-minute all-out "blow out" effort (clears anaerobic energy)</li>
                    <li>Easy spinning for 10 minutes</li>
                    <li>20-minute all-out effort (pace evenly!)</li>
                    <li>Cool down 10-15 minutes</li>
                    <li>Average power for 20 min x 0.95 = FTP</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Your FTP test came back at 250 watts. Is that good? What does it mean for your training and racing? Context matters enormously when interpreting FTP.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Context Is Everything</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A 250W FTP means very different things depending on:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Body weight:</strong> 250W at 60kg (4.17 W/kg) vs 250W at 90kg (2.78 W/kg)</li>
                    <li><strong>Training history:</strong> First year cycling vs 10 years of training</li>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> 25-year-old vs 55-year-old</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male vs female (different physiological norms)</li>
                    <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Recreational riding vs competitive racing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What Your FTP Tells You</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Current aerobic fitness:</strong> Your threshold capacity right now</li>
                    <li><strong>Training zone targets:</strong> All zones calculated from this number</li>
                    <li><strong>Racing pacing:</strong> How hard you can sustainably ride</li>
                    <li><strong>Progress tracking:</strong> Compare to past tests to see improvement</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What FTP Doesn't Tell You</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Sprint power:</strong> Short-duration power is separate from FTP</li>
                    <li><strong>5-minute power:</strong> VO2max efforts may not correlate directly</li>
                    <li><strong>Endurance capacity:</strong> FTP doesn't indicate how long you can ride</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical skills:</strong> Bike handling, descending, bunch riding</li>
                    <li><strong>Race tactics:</strong> When and how to attack</li>

                    <li><strong>Power creeps up during intervals:</strong> You finish above target consistently</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery is faster:</strong> You bounce back quickly from hard sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Sweet spot feels like tempo:</strong> 88-93% FTP efforts aren't challenging</li>
                    <li><strong>Training stress scores seem low:</strong> Despite consistent training volume</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A dropping FTP is every cyclist's nightmare. You've been training consistently, yet your latest test shows a 10-20 watt decrease. Before panicking, understand that FTP fluctuations are normal and often reversible.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Solution:</strong> Take 5-7 days completely off, then ease back with 2 weeks at 50% volume</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">1. Testing Too Often</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Testing every week or two doesn't allow time for adaptations. FTP changes slowly over weeks, not days.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Testing Too Rarely</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Training with a months-old FTP means your zones are likely wrong. Retest at least every 8 weeks during active training.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Your FTP journey is personal. Comparing to others with different genetics, training history, or body composition leads to frustration.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">4. Ignoring W/kg</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Chasing absolute watts while ignoring body composition. A 300W FTP at 90kg (3.33 W/kg) is less impressive than 250W at 65kg (3.85 W/kg) for most cycling applications.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">5. Training Zone Mistakes</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700">Going too hard on easy days and not hard enough on hard days. Zone 2 should feel easy; Zone 5 should feel very hard.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">All intensity, no base. Zone 2 training builds the foundation for everything else. Most training should be easy.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Testing indoors one month and outdoors the next, or at different times of day. Standardize conditions for valid comparisons.</p>

                        <div class="px-6 pb-6 text-gray-700">FTP varies widely by weight and training history. For recreational cyclists, 2.0-2.5 W/kg is typical. Well-trained amateurs reach 3.0-3.5 W/kg. Competitive cyclists often exceed 4.0 W/kg. Professional cyclists typically range from 5.5-6.5 W/kg.

Always retest at the start of a new training block and after illness or extended breaks.</div>

                        <div class="px-6 pb-6 text-gray-700">The 20-minute test requires you to ride all-out for 20 minutes, then multiply the average power by 0.95 to estimate FTP. It's the gold standard but pacing can be tricky. The ramp test increases power incrementally until failure and is quicker and less mentally demanding, but may overestimate FTP for some athletes, particularly those with strong anaerobic capacity.</div>
