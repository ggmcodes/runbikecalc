                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        <strong>The CrossFit Games</strong> is an annual athletic competition that serves as the world championship of the sport of fitness. Owned and operated by CrossFit, LLC, the Games crown the "Fittest on Earth" by testing athletes across a broad range of physical challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Unlike traditional sports that test one specific ability (running speed, lifting strength, etc.), CrossFit is designed to test <strong>general physical preparedness</strong>. Athletes must be ready for anything: Olympic weightlifting, gymnastics, running, swimming, cycling, rowing, and more.
                    </p>

                        <p class="text-blue-800"><strong>The Unknown and Unknowable:</strong> A core principle of the CrossFit Games is that workouts are not announced until competition time. Athletes must train for everything because they don't know what they'll face.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        The Games have grown from a small gathering of 70 athletes on a California ranch in 2007 to a major sporting event broadcast globally, with millions of dollars in prize money.

The competition includes age group divisions (Masters) for athletes 35-60+ and Adaptive divisions for athletes with physical differences. This means a 55-year-old grandmother and a wheelchair-using athlete can compete for world championship titles in their respective divisions.

                            <strong>Find a local CrossFit affiliate (gym).</strong> CrossFit gyms offer coached classes that teach proper technique. This is the safest and most effective way to learn.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Start with fundamentals.</strong> Most gyms offer an "On-Ramp" or "Foundations" program for beginners. Don't skip this.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Scale appropriately.</strong> Every workout can be scaled to your fitness level. There's no shame in using lighter weights or modified movements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Focus on technique first.</strong> Olympic lifts like snatches and cleans require proper form to be safe and effective.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Be consistent.</strong> Attend classes regularly. Progress comes from consistency over months and years.

                    <div class="space-y-4">
                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">Is CrossFit dangerous?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">Like any sport, CrossFit carries injury risk. However, when performed with proper coaching and appropriate scaling, it's no more dangerous than other fitness activities. Studies show injury rates similar to recreational weightlifting. The key is learning correct technique before adding intensity, and listening to your body.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">How much does CrossFit cost?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">CrossFit gym memberships typically range from $150-$300/month, depending on location. This includes coached classes, programming, and community support. Many find the cost worthwhile because of the coaching, accountability, and community compared to regular gym memberships.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">Can beginners do CrossFit?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">Absolutely! Every workout is scalable. Beginners start with lighter weights and modified movements, progressing as they build strength and skill. Good CrossFit coaches specialize in meeting people where they are.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">What's the CrossFit Open?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">The Open is an annual online competition where anyone can participate. Over three weeks, workouts are released and athletes complete them at their gym. It's the first step in the Games qualification process and a fun community event. Registration is about $20, and it's a great way to test your fitness and join the global CrossFit community.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">Do I need to be fit to start CrossFit?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">No! CrossFit is designed to get you fit, not require you to already be fit. Start where you are and progress at your own pace. The methodology is infinitely scalable.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">How long are CrossFit workouts?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">A typical CrossFit class is 60 minutes, including warm-up, skill work, the workout of the day (WOD), and cool-down. The actual workout portion usually ranges from 5-25 minutes, though some longer endurance pieces can extend beyond that.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">What is a WOD?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">WOD stands for "Workout of the Day" - the main workout programmed for each class. CrossFit gyms post their WOD daily, and everyone in class does the same workout (scaled to their level). Common WOD formats include AMRAPs (As Many Rounds As Possible), EMOMs (Every Minute On the Minute), and For Time workouts.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">Can I do CrossFit at home?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">Yes, though it's easier to start at a gym to learn proper technique. Home CrossFit requires minimal equipment - a pull-up bar, kettlebell, and jump rope can get you started. CrossFit.com posts free daily workouts, and many can be modified for home use.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="bg-white border rounded-lg">
                            <summary class="p-4 font-semibold cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50">How do I find a good CrossFit gym?</summary>
                            <p class="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-600">Look for gyms that offer a foundations/on-ramp program, have certified coaches, and emphasize technique before intensity. Visit a few gyms, try free classes, and assess the coaching quality and community vibe. A good gym will scale workouts appropriately and not push beginners too hard too fast.</p>
