                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-3">The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Garmin</strong> remains the gold standard for running watches with the most comprehensive training ecosystem, best software experience, and features like music storage that COROS lacks. The <strong>Forerunner 265</strong> ($449) is our top overall pick for most runners.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>COROS</strong> offers exceptional value and industry-leading battery life. The <strong>PACE 3</strong> ($229) delivers 90% of premium watch functionality at half the price, making it the best choice for budget-conscious runners and ultramarathoners who need multi-day battery life.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> If budget allows, go Garmin for the superior ecosystem. If value or battery life are priorities, COROS delivers outstanding performance for the money.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-3">Garmin</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Founded in 1989, Garmin is the dominant player in GPS sports watches with decades of experience. They pioneered GPS running watches and have the most mature software ecosystem.</p>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600"><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Olathe, Kansas, USA</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-3">COROS</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Founded in 2014, COROS is the upstart challenger that has rapidly gained market share by offering excellent GPS accuracy, unmatched battery life, and aggressive pricing.</p>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600"><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Santa Monica, California, USA</p>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600"><strong>Key Running Lines:</strong> PACE, APEX, VERTIX</p>
                        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600"><strong>Market Position:</strong> Value-focused, ultramarathon specialist</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The running watch market has been dominated by Garmin for over a decade, but COROS has emerged as a legitimate competitor by focusing on what ultramarathon and trail runners need most: battery life and GPS accuracy. While Garmin continues to lead in software sophistication and overall features, COROS has closed many gaps while maintaining significant advantages in battery life and pricing.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">Both brands now sponsor elite athletes: Garmin backs runners like Sara Hall and Jakob Ingebrigtsen, while COROS has signed ultrarunning legends Kilian Jornet, Courtney Dauwalter, and Camille Herron. This elite validation has helped COROS shed its "budget brand" image.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For marathoners, both brands provide adequate battery. But for ultramarathon runners tackling 100-mile races that can take 24-40 hours, COROS's battery advantage is game-changing. The APEX 2 Pro can handle most 100-milers without charging.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Garmin is better for runners who want comprehensive training analytics, music storage, and the most polished software experience. COROS is better for runners prioritizing battery life, value, and simplicity. For most runners, Garmin offers the more complete experience, but COROS delivers exceptional value.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Both brands now offer dual-frequency/multi-band GPS with comparable accuracy. In our testing, both tracked within 1-2% of measured courses.

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, COROS watches offer superior battery life across all price tiers. The PACE 3 delivers 38 hours of GPS versus 20 hours for the Forerunner 265. For ultramarathon runners, COROS's battery advantage is significant and often the deciding factor.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, COROS is excellent for beginners. The interface is simpler and less overwhelming than Garmin's feature-rich approach. The COROS app is straightforward, and the watches provide core running metrics without information overload.</p>

                <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-6">
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>Garmin</strong> remains the overall leader in running watches thanks to its comprehensive training ecosystem, music storage, premium displays, and mature software. If you want the best overall experience and don't mind paying more, the <strong>Forerunner 265</strong> is our top recommendation.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><strong>COROS</strong> has emerged as a legitimate competitor that excels in battery life and value. For ultramarathon runners, budget-conscious athletes, or anyone who prioritizes simplicity over features, the <strong>PACE 3</strong> offers incredible value that's hard to beat.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">The good news? Both brands make excellent running watches. You can't go wrong with either choice - it comes down to whether you prioritize comprehensive features (Garmin) or battery life and value (COROS).</p>
