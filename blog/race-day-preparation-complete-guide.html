                You've put in months of training. You've logged the miles, survived the intervals, and sacrificed weekend sleep for long runs. Now comes race day—where everything you've worked for either comes together or falls apart based on preparation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Race day preparation isn't just about what you do the morning of. It's a systematic process that begins during taper week and extends through your post-race recovery. Get it right, and you'll maximize every ounce of fitness you've built. Get it wrong, and you'll leave minutes on the table—or worse, not finish at all.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This guide covers everything you need to know to execute the perfect race day, from sleep banking and carb loading to warm-up protocols and mental strategies. Let's make sure all that training translates into your best performance.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mb-4">Tapering Done Right</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Tapering is a systematic reduction in training volume while maintaining intensity to allow your body to fully recover and supercompensate. The length and depth of your taper depends on race distance:
            </p>

            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Taper Timeline by Distance</h4>
                <ul class="space-y-3">
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-primary font-bold mr-3">5K-10K:</span>
                        <span>4-7 day taper. Reduce volume by 40-50%. Include 2-3 short sessions with race-pace segments.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start">

                        <span>7-10 day taper. Reduce volume by 50-60%. Last hard workout 10 days out, last race-pace work 5-7 days out.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-primary font-bold mr-3">Marathon:</span>
                        <span>2-3 week taper. Reduce volume by 60-75%. Last long run 2-3 weeks out (12-16 miles). Last hard workout 10-14 days out.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="flex items-start">
                        <span class="text-primary font-bold mr-3">Ironman/Ultra:</span>
                        <span>3-4 week taper. Reduce volume by 70-80%. Final long training session 3-4 weeks out. Last hard effort 2-3 weeks out.</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                During taper, you'll feel restless. You might even feel sluggish. This is normal. Trust the process. Your body is using this reduced load to repair microdamage, top off glycogen stores, and strengthen the adaptations you've built. More training during taper week doesn't make you fitter—it just makes you more tired.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mb-4">Sleep Banking</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Research shows that the sleep you get two nights before a race matters more than the night immediately before. Many athletes are too excited or anxious to sleep well the night before—and that's okay if you've "banked" sleep in the preceding week.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 mb-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Sleep Banking Protocol</h4>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Week Before Race:</strong> Aim for 8-9 hours per night (add 30-60 minutes to normal)</li>
                    <li><strong>3 Days Before:</strong> Prioritize 9 hours if possible</li>
                    <li><strong>2 Days Before:</strong> This is the critical night—get 8-9 hours minimum</li>
                    <li><strong>Night Before:</strong> Aim for 7-8 hours, but don't stress if you only get 5-6</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Create optimal sleep conditions: cool room (65-68°F), blackout curtains, white noise if needed, and no screens 1-2 hours before bed. Consider melatonin (0.3-3mg) if you're traveling across time zones, but test it during training first.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mb-4">Carb Loading Strategy</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Carb loading increases muscle glycogen stores by 25-100%, providing more fuel for races lasting 90+ minutes. This isn't an excuse for a pasta binge—it's a calculated nutrition strategy.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>How to carb load properly:</strong> For a 70kg (154lb) athlete doing a full load, that's 700-840g of carbs per day. Focus on easily digestible sources: white rice, pasta, bread, potatoes, oatmeal, bananas, sports drinks. Reduce fiber, fat, and protein slightly to make room for carbs without overeating.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                You'll gain 2-4 pounds during carb loading—this is normal and desirable. Every gram of glycogen stores 3-4 grams of water. This water will fuel your performance, not slow you down.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mb-4">Race Week Training</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Your final week should maintain fitness without adding fatigue. Here's a sample marathon race week:

                    <li><strong>1. Test Everything:</strong> Never try new foods on race morning. Test your exact breakfast during long training runs.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Low Fiber:</strong> Avoid high-fiber cereals, beans, excessive vegetables. You don't want GI distress.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Low Fat:</strong> Fat slows digestion. Save the avocado and bacon for post-race celebration.</li>
                    <li><strong>4. Moderate Protein:</strong> Small amount is fine, but carbs are the priority.</li>
                    <li><strong>5. Easy on Liquids:</strong> Sip don't chug. 8-16oz with breakfast, then small sips until 30 min before start.</li>
                    <li><strong>6. Individual Tolerance:</strong> Some athletes do fine with 600 calories, others prefer 300. Know yourself.</li>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This is your primary pre-race meal. The 2-4 hour window allows enough time for digestion and absorption without feeling heavy. Larger meals need more time; lighter meals can be closer to start.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Physical preparation gets you to the starting line. Mental preparation determines what happens after the gun goes off. Elite athletes spend as much time preparing their minds as their bodies.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-dark mb-6">8. Managing Pre-Race Nerves and Anxiety</h2>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Some nervousness before a race is normal—even beneficial. Arousal improves performance up to a point. The key is channeling that nervous energy rather than letting it spiral into debilitating anxiety.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mb-4">Breathing Techniques</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Controlled breathing activates your parasympathetic nervous system, countering the fight-or-flight response. Use these techniques the night before and race morning.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">Use this when anxiety spikes or you can't sleep the night before:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Inhale</strong> through nose for 4 seconds</li>
                    <li><strong>Hold</strong> for 4 seconds</li>
                    <li><strong>Exhale</strong> through mouth for 4 seconds</li>
                    <li><strong>Hold</strong> empty for 4 seconds</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> for 5-10 cycles</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Physiological Sigh</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">The fastest way to calm down in the moment (at start line, in porta-potty line):</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Inhale deeply</strong> through nose until lungs are 75% full</li>
                    <li><strong>Second inhale</strong> through nose to completely fill lungs</li>
                    <li><strong>Long exhale</strong> through mouth (6-8 seconds)</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> 2-3 times for rapid anxiety reduction</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mb-4">Reframing Nerves as Excitement</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Research shows that reframing anxiety as excitement improves performance more than trying to calm down. Your body's physiological response to anxiety and excitement is nearly identical—it's your interpretation that differs.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-primary p-6 mb-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Reframing Exercise</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">When you notice nervous symptoms, use these statements:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li>Instead of: "I'm so nervous" → Say: "I'm excited and ready"</li>
                    <li>Instead of: "My heart is racing" → Say: "My body is preparing for performance"</li>
                    <li>Instead of: "I might fail" → Say: "I have an opportunity to succeed"</li>
                    <li>Instead of: "There's so much pressure" → Say: "I get to test my training"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mb-4">Distraction Strategies</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Sometimes the best approach is to not think about the race at all. Give your mind a break from constant race thoughts.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Pre-Race Distractions</h4>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Music:</strong> Create a pump-up playlist or calming playlist (know which you need)</li>
                    <li><strong>Podcasts/Audiobooks:</strong> Listen during drive to race or while waiting</li>
                    <li><strong>Chat with Other Racers:</strong> Shared nervousness is bonding</li>
                    <li><strong>Familiar Routine:</strong> Read same article, do same warm-up, wear same socks</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Social Media:</strong> Don't compare yourself to others' posts</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Others:</strong> Help a nervous first-timer; shifts focus from yourself</li>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This is the most common pre-race anxiety: lying awake the night before, watching hours tick by, panicking about lost sleep.

                    <li><strong>Don't Panic:</strong> One poor night won't ruin your race if you've sleep banked</li>
                    <li><strong>Rest is Good Too:</strong> Lying quietly with eyes closed provides 70% of sleep benefits</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Box Breathing:</strong> Shift focus from "I can't sleep" to breathing pattern</li>
                    <li><strong>Progressive Relaxation:</strong> Tense and release each muscle group from toes to head</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Clock Watching:</strong> Turn clock away; checking time increases anxiety</li>
                    <li><strong>Get Up If Needed:</strong> After 30 minutes of trying, read something boring in dim light</li>
                    <li><strong>Remember Past Success:</strong> Recall training runs you crushed on little sleep</li>

                    <li><strong>Walk & Move:</strong> Light movement aids digestion and reduces cramping</li>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Race day weather rarely cooperates. Being prepared for heat, cold, wind, or rain can mean the difference between a PR and a DNF.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-dark mb-4">Hot Weather Racing (75°F+)</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Heat is the most dangerous weather condition. Performance declines 1-2% for every 5°F above 60°F, and heat illness can be life-threatening.
            </p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Hot Weather Strategy</h4>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Adjust Expectations:</strong> Slower paces are necessary. Add 20-60 seconds per mile to goal pace depending on heat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Increase intake. Drink at every aid station, even just a few sips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrolytes:</strong> Critical in heat. Use salt tabs or electrolyte drinks, not just water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooling Strategies:</strong> Pour water on head/neck at aid stations. Wear light-colored, loose clothing. Use ice in hat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> Apply 30 minutes before race. Reapply if race is 2+ hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Early Warning Signs:</strong> Dizziness, nausea, goosebumps, confusion = stop immediately and get help.</li>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Cold weather is less dangerous than heat, but still requires strategy. The challenge is staying warm before the race without overheating during it.

                    <li><strong>Layering Rule:</strong> Dress as if it's 15-20°F warmer than actual temp (you'll warm up fast)</li>
                    <li><strong>Throwaway Layers:</strong> Wear old sweatshirt/gloves to start, discard at mile 1-2</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect Extremities:</strong> Gloves, hat, and warm socks are critical. Ears and fingers go numb first.</li>
                    <li><strong>Core Temperature:</strong> Thin base layer, race top, windbreaker if very cold/windy</li>
                    <li><strong>Warm-Up:</strong> Do it inside if possible, or stay moving constantly outside</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-Race:</strong> Get dry clothes on immediately. Hypothermia risk is highest after finishing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Cold reduces gut motility; warm breakfast may be easier to digest</li>

                    <li><strong>30-40°F:</strong> Tights or pants, long sleeve, gloves, headband/hat</li>
                    <li><strong>20-30°F:</strong> Add base layer, windbreaker, heavier gloves, full hat</li>

                    <li><strong>Shoe Choice:</strong> Shoes with drainage holes are ideal. Regular shoes work but will be heavy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Throwaway Poncho:</strong> Wear garbage bag with holes for arms/head until start</li>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-dark mb-3">What should I eat the morning of a race?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Eat a familiar, easily digestible breakfast 2-4 hours before start time. For a 5K-10K: 200-300 calories (toast with banana, oatmeal). For half marathon: 300-400 calories (bagel with peanut butter, oatmeal with honey). For marathon/ultra: 400-600 calories (large bowl of oatmeal, toast with jam and banana). Focus on carbs, minimal fiber and fat. Always test your race morning meal during training—never try something new on race day.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-dark mb-3">How long should I warm up before a race?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Warm-up duration is inversely proportional to race distance. 5K: 15-20 minutes with dynamic stretching and 3-4 strides. 10K-Half: 10-15 minutes of easy jogging and 2-3 strides. Marathon: 5-10 minutes of easy movement and dynamic stretching. The shorter and faster the race, the longer and more intense the warm-up should be. For marathons, the first few miles serve as your warm-up, so minimal pre-race movement conserves glycogen.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-dark mb-3">Should I carb load for every race?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Carb loading is most beneficial for races lasting 90+ minutes. For marathons, ultras, long-course triathlons, and century rides, increase carbs to 10-12g per kg body weight for 24-48 hours before. For 5K-10K races, normal eating is sufficient since glycogen depletion isn't a limiting factor. For half marathons, a moderate carb increase (7-8g/kg) the day before can help but isn't critical. The shorter the race, the less important carb loading becomes.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-dark mb-3">How do I manage pre-race anxiety?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Use controlled breathing techniques like box breathing (4 seconds in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold) or physiological sighs to activate your parasympathetic nervous system. Practice positive visualization of successful race segments. Focus on process goals (pacing, nutrition, form) rather than outcome goals. Arrive early to reduce time pressure. Stick to familiar routines. Reframe nervousness as excitement—your body's arousal response is identical for both. Remember that some nervousness is normal and can actually enhance performance when channeled properly.

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-dark mb-3">What time should I wake up on race morning?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                        Wake up 3-4 hours before start time for optimal digestion and alertness. If your race starts at 7 AM, wake at 3:30-4 AM. This allows sufficient time for breakfast to digest (2-4 hours before start), bathroom routines, arrival at venue (60-90 minutes early), gear check, warm-up (15-30 minutes before), and final preparations without rushing. Yes, it's early, but the alternative is arriving stressed and unprepared, which will hurt your performance more than lost sleep.

                        The biggest mistakes are: (1) trying new gear or nutrition on race day instead of testing in training, (2) starting too fast and burning matches you can't recover, (3) inadequate warm-up especially for shorter races, (4) arriving late and rushing through pre-race routine, (5) ignoring weather conditions and not adjusting clothing or pacing, (6) deviating from your tested race plan, (7) consuming too much or too little fluid leading to GI issues, and (8) forgetting essential items like race bib, nutrition, or timing chip. The golden rule: Nothing new on race day. Stick to what you practiced in training.
