## NOTES FOR TEAM

1. **Content First**: Write for users first, search engines second. Natural language is always better than forced keywords.

2. **Quality Over Quantity**: One excellent 6,000-word article beats three mediocre 2,000-word articles.

3. **Link Gradually**: Don't add 100 internal links all at once. Spread implementation over 2-3 weeks to avoid looking artificial.

4. **Monitor Continuously**: Rankings fluctuate. Track changes weekly, but don't panic over 1-2 position movements. Focus on 30-day trends.

5. **User Experience is Key**: Fast load times, mobile optimization, and clear navigation matter as much as keywords.

6. **Maintenance Plan**: After initial optimization, plan for quarterly reviews and updates. SEO is ongoing, not one-time.

7. **Stay Current**: Google algorithm updates periodically. Review strategy quarterly and adjust based on performance data.
