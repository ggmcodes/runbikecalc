## CONCLUSION

RunBikeCalc has a strong foundation but significant opportunities exist to:

1. **Fill Testing & Assessment Gap** - Biggest opportunity with high traffic
2. **Capture Women Athletes** - Underserved niche with strong demand
3. **Expand MTB & Gravel** - Growing sports with minimal coverage
4. **Build Environmental Content** - Becoming increasingly important
5. **Create Injury Prevention Hub** - Consistent high-traffic searches

**Recommended Focus:** Start with testing protocols + quick-win calculators, then build out women athletes hub and injury prevention cluster. This creates both immediate traffic gains and sustainable competitive differentiation.

**Estimated Timeline:** 90 days to implement Phase 1 & 2 with 1-2 part-time content creators + developer for calculator tools.

**Expected Impact:** 30-50% increase in organic traffic by end of Q2 2026, with potential for 2-3 new high-authority topic clusters established by Q3 2026.
