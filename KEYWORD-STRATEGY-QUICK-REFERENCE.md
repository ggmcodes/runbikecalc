1. **Maintain Natural Language**: All LSI keyword additions should sound natural - use synonyms and variations
2. **Avoid Keyword Stuffing**: Never force keywords - write for humans first
3. **Update Internal Links Responsibly**: Use contextual anchor text that benefits users
4. **Test Changes**: Monitor rankings weekly during first 60 days
5. **Preserve Existing Strengths**: Schema markup, mobile optimization, page speed all excellent - maintain these
6. **Prioritize Critical Pages**: Start with FTP and VO2 Max calculators (lowest rankings)
7. **Video Assets**: High ROI - prioritize Cooper test protocol and FTP testing videos
